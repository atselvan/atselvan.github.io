# Jenkins

Jenkins orchestrator that offers a simple way to set up a [continuous integration](http://docs.privatesquare.in/blog/cicd-fundamentals/#what-is-continuous-intergration-ci) or [continuous delivery](http://docs.privatesquare.in/blog/cicd-fundamentals/#what-is-continuous-delivery) environment for almost any combination of languages and source code repositories using pipelines, as well as automating other routine development tasks. While Jenkins doesnâ€™t eliminate the need to create scripts for individual steps, it does give you a faster and more robust way to integrate your entire chain of build, test, and deployment tools than you can easily build yourself.
