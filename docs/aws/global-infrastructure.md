## Understanding the difference between a region, an Availabity Zone (AZ) and an Edge Location

* A region is a physical location in the world which consists of two or more Availability Zones.
* An Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.
* Edge locations are endpoints for AWS which are used for cacheing content. Typically it consists of CloudFront which is Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN)
