# Container Orchestration Tools

Container orchestration tools can be broadly defined as providing an enterprise-level framework for integrating and managing containers at scale. Such tools aim to simplify container management and provide a framework not only for defining initial container deployment but also for managing multiple containers as one entity -- for purposes of availability, scaling, and networking.

Some container orchestration tools to know about include:

Amazon ECS -- The Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS) supports Docker containers and lets you run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

Azure Container Service (ACS) -- ACS lets you create a cluster of virtual machines that act as container hosts along with master machines that are used to manage your application containers.

Cloud Foundryâ€™s Diego -- Diego is a container management system that combines a scheduler, runner, and health manager. It is a rewrite of the Cloud Foundry runtime.

CoreOS Fleet -- Fleet is a container management tool that lets you deploy Docker containers on hosts in a cluster as well as distribute services across a cluster.

Docker Swarm -- Docker Swarm provides native clustering functionality for Docker containers, which lets you turn a group of Docker engines into a single, virtual Docker engine.

Google Container Engine -- Google Container Engine, which is built on Kubernetes, lets you run Docker containers on the Google Cloud platform. It schedules containers into the cluster and manages them based on user-defined requirements.

Kubernetes -- Kubernetes is an orchestration system for Docker containers. It handles scheduling and manages workloads based on user-defined parameters.

Mesosphere Marathon -- Marathon is a container orchestration framework for Apache Mesos that is designed to launch long-running applications. It offers key features for running applications in a clustered environment.
